This is a simple plugin to split a list into two at the half way point. 

To use, just call it on the list you wish to split into two, eg:
$("#myBigList").splitList();

It will insert two unordered lists after #myBigList, the first list containing the first half of the items in the original list, the second list containing the second half. The initial list is then removed from the DOM.
